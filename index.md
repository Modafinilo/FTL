<h3>Aim</h3>
</p>

This workshop aims to bring together researchers tackling active matter and out-of equilibrium problems from a field-theoretic perspective and experimental biophysicists. Applied mathematicians, physicists and biophysicists are expected to benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of the workshop, which will serve as a catalyst for fruitful collaborations and also attract young researchers to the field. The workshop will focus on the presentation of tools, new advances in the field and discussion of open problems. A generous amount of time will be left for discussion and networking. 

<p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
</p>
The workshop is a 1-day event and will provide opportunities for senior scientists as well as early career scientists to present their research in review talks or in shorter presentations and on posters. The schedule allows for generous time for discussions and networking. 

Duration of the talks: 45 min + 15 min of questions.
There will be poster presentations during the day; students are encouraged to participate!
